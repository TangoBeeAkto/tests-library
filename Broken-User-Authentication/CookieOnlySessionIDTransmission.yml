  name: "Cookie-Only Transmission of Session IDs"
  description: > 
    "This test refers to a security practice where session IDs are exclusively communicated 
    through HTTP cookies during user authentication. This method enhances confidentiality 
    by preventing the exposure of session information in other parts of the request. By 
    ensuring that session IDs are confined to cookies, potential vulnerabilities associated 
    with alternative transmission methods, such as URLs or headers, are mitigated, reinforcing 
    the overall security posture of web applications."
  details: >
    "This test is a security measure ensuring that session IDs are exclusively conveyed 
    via HTTP cookies during user authentication. This practice enhances data 
    confidentiality by limiting the exposure of session information to cookies alone, 
    mitigating the risk associated with other transmission channels. By adhering to 
    this approach, web applications bolster their security, preventing potential 
    vulnerabilities that might arise from alternative methods of transmitting 
    session IDs."
  impact: >
    "The impact of enforcing "Cookie-Only Transmission of Session IDs" is significant 
    for web security. This practice enhances data confidentiality by reducing the 
    risk of session ID exposure through alternative channels, such as URLs or 
    headers. It mitigates the potential for unauthorized access and reinforces 
    the overall integrity of user sessions. Implementing this approach is 
    essential for maintaining a robust defense against session-related vulnerabilities 
    in web applications."
